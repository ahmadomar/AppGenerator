# AppGenerator
Hi Everyone, this is a complete project file, so what's an apps generator, let me ask you :) In 2015 I've thought about letting the users generate web applications without typing any code, so I have written down the whole documentation about the features and the technologies I should use on it, here I give you a situation to generate the application from scratch "Admin" based app with CRUS operations, but here I have a competition with Microsoft to generate a full app for both "Admin" and "Client" and I have stopped working on it, so I thought one of you may use this app to generate any future app.
 
 #features:
 
 - Generate a full project file with '.csproj' with its referenced libraries with the published file.
 - Publish the full project to 'Azure Websites' directly and choose your domain name.\
 - Choose your theme.

#Technologies:
- C#
- ASP.NET & MVC
- Entity Framework
- Azure Websites

#You should have:
- Azure account and configure the subscription id.

#If you find something wrong, please let me know, it's an old app :)
